        The logo of our brand is a Khanda Sword which represents Hukam meaning the divine will or Shakti. 
        Chandi Di Vaar (The Ballad of Chandi) is a philosophical and spiritual composition written by 
        Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj in which he explains that the divine will always have a negative and 
        positive aspect which can be attributed to the double-edged sword called Khanda. 
        The creator first made this Hukam and then the whole universe was manifested.

      <p className='mt-5'>
        As I connect with the light within, my creative process is guided by the eternal love that becomes 
        a lifelong muse. My prayer for everyone who wears our clothes is to realize the divine will and flow 
        into the ocean of abundance. Guru Nanak's eternal message of oneness has become the essence of my 
        being as I bring to you Divinity through Design.
